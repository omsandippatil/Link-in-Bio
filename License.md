# The "Please Don't Steal My Stuff But If You Do At Least Make It Funny" License

Version 1.0, [Current Year]

## Preamble

This license is for people who take their code seriously but not themselves. If you're looking for something legally binding, you're in the wrong place. Turn back now.

## Terms and Conditions

1. You are granted the right to look at this code, laugh at it, cry over it, or use it as a cautionary tale.

2. You may copy, modify, and distribute this code, but only if you're prepared to live with the consequences of your actions.

3. If you use this code and your computer explodes, your hair catches fire, or your plants wilt, that's on you. We take no responsibility for any digital or horticultural disasters.

4. You may not use this code for evil. "Evil" is defined as anything that would make Mr. Rogers disappointed in you.

5. If you improve this code, you're legally obligated to send the author a virtual high-five. Or a real one, if you ever meet in person.

6. You are forbidden from using this code to create any form of social media platform. The world has enough of those, thank you very much.

7. If you make millions using this code, you owe the author a fancy dinner. Nothing less than a 3-star Michelin restaurant will do.

8. You may not complain about this code. You get what you pay for, and you paid nothing.

9. If you do steal this code, you must add a minimum of three (3) witty comments to it. This is non-negotiable.

10. By using this code, you agree to pet a dog (or cat, if you're a cat person) at least once a week. This improves code quality through totally scientific means.

## Disclaimer

This license is about as legally binding as a pinky promise. Use at your own risk, and may the force be with you.
