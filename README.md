# 🔗 Link in Bio: The Digital Breadcrumb Trail

> Warning: This page may cause severe nostalgia and an inexplicable desire to play Oregon Trail.

## What is this madness?

Welcome to the digital equivalent of a mix-tape, but instead of songs, it's a collection of links that scream "This is me!" Congratulations, you've found the HTML version of my soul.

## Features

- 🦖 Retro terminal aesthetics (because nothing says "hire me" like a color scheme from 1982)
- 🔗 Links that actually work (60% of the time, every time)
- 💾 Lightweight design (loads faster than your grandma's dial-up)
- 🕹️ No JavaScript (because we like our pages like we like our coffee - static)

## Installation

1. Clone this repo (if you can figure out how)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Marvel at the orange glow of pure, unadulterated HTML

## Usage

1. Click links
2. Get lost in the rabbit hole that is my digital existence
3. Question your life choices
4. Repeat

## Contributing
